1.  Introduction

   The Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM)
   standardized in [FIPS203] is a quantum-resistant key-encapsulation
   mechanism (KEM) standardized by the US National Institute of
   Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC Project [NIST-PQC].  Prior to
   standardization, the earlier versions of the mechanism were known as
   Kyber.  ML-KEM and Kyber are not compatible.  This document specifies
   the use of ML-KEM in Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX)
   certificates [RFC5280] at three security levels: ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-
   768, and ML-KEM-1024, using object identifiers assigned by NIST.  The
   private key format is also specified.

1.1.  Applicability Statement

   ML-KEM certificates are used in protocols where the public key is
   used to generate and encapsulate a shared secret used to derive a
   symmetric key used to encrypt a payload; see
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kyber].  To be used in TLS, ML-KEM certificates
   could only be used as end-entity identity certificates and would
   require significant updates to the protocol; see
   [I-D.celi-wiggers-tls-authkem].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Algorithm Identifiers

   The AlgorithmIdentifier type is defined in [RFC5912] as follows:

    AlgorithmIdentifier{ALGORITHM-TYPE, ALGORITHM-TYPE:AlgorithmSet} ::=
      SEQUENCE {
        algorithm   ALGORITHM-TYPE.&id({AlgorithmSet}),
        parameters  ALGORITHM-TYPE.
                      &Params({AlgorithmSet}{@algorithm}) OPTIONAL
      }

      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5912] and is compatible with
      |  the 2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].  See [RFC5280] for the 1988 ASN.1
      |  syntax.

   The fields in AlgorithmIdentifier have the following meanings:

   *  algorithm identifies the cryptographic algorithm with an object
      identifier.

   *  parameters, which are optional, are the associated parameters for
      the algorithm identifier in the algorithm field.

   The AlgorithmIdentifier for a ML-KEM public key MUST use one of the
   id-alg-ml-kem object identifiers listed below, based on the security
   level.  The parameters field of the AlgorithmIdentifier for the ML-
   KEM public key MUST be absent.

   When any of the ML-KEM AlgorithmIdentifier appears in the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo field of an X.509 certificate, the key usage
   certificate extension MUST only contain keyEncipherment
   Section 4.2.1.3 of [RFC5280].

     nistAlgorithms OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-ccitt(2)
       country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
       nistAlgorithm(4) }

     kems OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { nistAlgorithms 4 }

     id-alg-ml-kem-512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 1 }

     id-alg-ml-kem-768 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 2 }

     id-alg-ml-kem-1024 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 3 }

     pk-ml-kem-512 PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
       IDENTIFIER id-alg-ml-kem-512
       -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       PARAMS ARE absent
       CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
       --- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       }

     pk-ml-kem-768 PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
       IDENTIFIER id-alg-ml-kem-768
       -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       PARAMS ARE absent
       CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
       --- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       }

     pk-ml-kem-1024 PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
       IDENTIFIER id-alg-ml-kem-1024
       -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       PARAMS ARE absent
       CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
       --- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       }

       ML-KEM-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (800 | 1184 | 1568))

       ML-KEM-PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (64))

   No additional encoding of the ML-KEM public key value is applied in
   the SubjectPublicKeyInfo field of an X.509 certificate [RFC5280].
   However, whenever it appears outside of a certificate, it MAY be
   encoded as an OCTET STRING.

   No additional encoding of the ML-KEM private key value is applied in
   the PrivateKeyInfo field of an Asymmetric Key Package [RFC5958].
   However, whenever it appears outside of a Asymmetric Key Package, it
   MAY be encoded as an OCTET STRING.

4.  Subject Public Key Fields

   In the X.509 certificate, the subjectPublicKeyInfo field has the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, which has the following ASN.1 syntax:

     SubjectPublicKeyInfo {PUBLIC-KEY: IOSet} ::= SEQUENCE {
         algorithm        AlgorithmIdentifier {PUBLIC-KEY, {IOSet}},
         subjectPublicKey BIT STRING
     }

      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5912] and is compatible with
      |  the 2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].  See [RFC5280] for the 1988 ASN.1
      |  syntax.

   The fields in SubjectPublicKeyInfo have the following meaning:

   *  algorithm is the algorithm identifier and parameters for the
      public key (see above).

   *  subjectPublicKey contains the byte stream of the public key.

   Appendix C.2 contains examples for ML-KEM public keys encoded using
   the textual encoding defined in [RFC7468].

5.  Private Key Format

   In short, an ML-KEM private key is encoded by storing its 64-octet
   seed in the privateKey field as follows.

   [FIPS203] specifies two formats for an ML-KEM private key: a 64-octet
   seed and an (expanded) private key, which is referred to as the
   decapsulation key.  The expanded private key (and public key) is
   computed from the seed using ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal(d,z) (algorithm
   16) using the first 32 octets as _d_ and the remaining 32 octets as
   _z_.

   A keypair is generated by sampling 64 octets uniformly at random for
   the seed (private key) from a cryptographically secure pseudorandom
   number generator (CSPRNGs).  The public key can then be computed
   using ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal(d,z) as described earlier.

   "Asymmetric Key Packages" [RFC5958] describes how to encode a private
   key in a structure that both identifies what algorithm the private
   key is for and allows for the public key and additional attributes
   about the key to be included as well.  For illustration, the ASN.1
   structure OneAsymmetricKey is replicated below.

     OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
       version                  Version,
       privateKeyAlgorithm      SEQUENCE {
       algorithm                PUBLIC-KEY.&id({PublicKeySet}),
       parameters               PUBLIC-KEY.&Params({PublicKeySet}
                                  {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})
                                     OPTIONAL}
       privateKey               OCTET STRING (CONTAINING
                                  PUBLIC-KEY.&PrivateKey({PublicKeySet}
                                    {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})),
       attributes           [0] Attributes OPTIONAL,
       ...,
       [[2: publicKey       [1] BIT STRING (CONTAINING
                                  PUBLIC-KEY.&Params({PublicKeySet}
                                    {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})
                                    OPTIONAL,
       ...
     }

      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5958] and is compatible with
      |  the 2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].

   When used in a OneAsymmetricKey type, the privateKey OCTET STRING
   contains the raw octet string encoding of the 64-octet seed.  The
   publicKey field SHOULD be omitted because the public key can be
   computed as noted earlier in this section.

   Appendix C.1 contains examples for ML-KEM private keys encoded using
   the textual encoding defined in [RFC7468].

6.  Implementation Considerations

   Though section 7.1 of [FIPS203] mentions the potential to save seed
   values for future expansion, Algorithm 19 does not make the seed
   values available to a caller for serialization.  Similarly, the
   algorithm that expands seed values is not listed as one of the "main
   algorithms" and features "internal" in the name even though it is
   clear that it is allowed to be exposed externally for the purposes of
   expanding a key from a seed.  Below are possible ways to extend the
   APIs defined in [FIPS203] to support serialization of seed values as
   private keys.

   To support serialization of seed values as private keys, let
   Algorithm 19b denote the same procedure as Algorithm 19 in [FIPS203]
   except it returns (ek, dk, d, z) on line 7.  Additionally, Algorithm
   16 should be promoted to be a "main algorithm" for external use in
   expanding seed values.

   Note also that unlike other private key compression methods in other
   algorithms, expanding a private key from a seed is a one-way
   function, meaning that once a full key is expanded from seed and the
   seed discarded, the seed cannot be re-created even if the full
   expanded private key is available.  For this reason it is RECOMMENDED
   that implementations retain and export the seed, even when also
   exporting the expanded key.

7.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations section of [RFC5280] applies to this
   specification as well.

   Protection of the private-key information, i.e., the seed, is vital
   to public-key cryptography.  Disclosure of the private-key material
   to another entity can lead to masquerades.

   For ML-KEM specific security considerations refer to
   [I-D.sfluhrer-cfrg-ml-kem-security-considerations].

   The generation of private keys relies on random numbers.  The use of
   inadequate pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to generate these
   values can result in little or no security.  An attacker may find it
   much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced the keys,
   searching the resulting small set of possibilities, rather than brute
   force searching the whole key space.  The generation of quality
   random numbers is difficult, and [RFC4086] offers important guidance
   in this area.

   ML-KEM key generation as standardized in [FIPS203] has specific
   requirements around randomness generation, described in section 3.3,
   'Randomness generation'.

   Key formats have implications on KEM binding properties, initially
   formalized in [CDM23].  Per the analysis of the final [FIPS203] in
   [KEMMY24], a compliant instantiation of ML-KEM is LEAK-BIND-K-PK-
   secure and LEAK-BIND-K-CT-secure when using the expanded key format,
   but not MAL-BIND-K-PK-secure nor MAL-BIND-K-CT-secure.  This means
   that the computed shared secret binds to the encapsulation key used
   to compute it against a malicious adversary that has access to
   leaked, honestly-generated key material but is not capable of
   manufacturing maliciously generated keypairs.  This binding to the
   encapsulation key broadly protects against re-encapsulation attacks
   but not completely.

   Using the 64-byte seed format provides a step up in binding security
   by mitigating an attack enabled by the hash of the public
   encapsulation key stored in the expanded private decapsulation key
   format, providing MAL-BIND-K-CT security and LEAK-BIND-K-PK security.

8.  IANA Considerations

   For the ASN.1 Module in Appendix A, IANA is requested to assign an
   object identifier (OID) for the module identifier (TBD) with a
   Description of "id-mod-x509-ml-kem-2024".  The OID for the module
   should be allocated in the "SMI Security for PKIX Module Identifier"
   registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0).

Appendix B.  Parameter Set Security and Sizes

   Instead of defining the strength of a quantum algorithm in a
   traditional manner using the imprecise notion of bits of security,
   NIST has defined security levels by picking a reference scheme, which
   NIST expects to offer notable levels of resistance to both quantum
   and classical attack.  To wit, a KEM algorithm that achieves NIST PQC
   security must require computational resources to break IND-CCA2
   security comparable or greater than that required for key search on
   AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 for Levels 1, 3, and 5, respectively.
   Levels 2 and 4 use collision search for SHA-256 and SHA-384 as
   reference.

Appendix C.  Examples

   This appendix contains examples of ML-KEM public keys, private keys
   and certificates.

C.1.  Example Private Key

   The following is an example of a ML-KEM-512 private key with hex seed
   0001…3f:

   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   MFICAQAwCwYJYIZIAWUDBAQBBEAAAQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEBESExQVFhcYGRob
   HB0eHyAhIiMkJSYnKCkqKywtLi8wMTIzNDU2Nzg5Ojs8PT4/
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

   0  82: SEQUENCE
   2   2:  INTEGER 0
   5  11:  SEQUENCE {
   7   9:   OBJECT IDENTIFIER '2.16.840.1.101.3.4.4.1'
        :   }
   18 64:  OCTET STRING
        :    00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f
        :    10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f
        :    20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f
        :    30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3a 3b 3c 3d 3e 3f
        :  }

   The following is an example of a ML-KEM-768 private key from the same
   seed.

   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   MFICAQAwCwYJYIZIAWUDBAQCBEAAAQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEBESExQVFhcYGRob
   HB0eHyAhIiMkJSYnKCkqKywtLi8wMTIzNDU2Nzg5Ojs8PT4/
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

   0  82: SEQUENCE
   2   2:  INTEGER 0
   5  11:  SEQUENCE {
   7   9:   OBJECT IDENTIFIER '2.16.840.1.101.3.4.4.2'
        :   }
   18 64:  OCTET STRING
        :    00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f
        :    10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f
        :    20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f
        :    30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3a 3b 3c 3d 3e 3f
        :  }

   The following is an example of a ML-KEM-1024 private key from the
   same seed.

   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   MFICAQAwCwYJYIZIAWUDBAQDBEAAAQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEBESExQVFhcYGRob
   HB0eHyAhIiMkJSYnKCkqKywtLi8wMTIzNDU2Nzg5Ojs8PT4/
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

   0  82: SEQUENCE
   2   2:  INTEGER 0
   5  11:  SEQUENCE {
   7   9:   OBJECT IDENTIFIER '2.16.840.1.101.3.4.4.3'
        :   }
   18 64:  OCTET STRING
        :    00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f
        :    10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f
        :    20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f
        :    30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3a 3b 3c 3d 3e 3f
        :  }

      |  NOTE: The private key is the seed and all three examples keys
      |  use the same seed; therefore, the private above are the same
      |  except for the OID used to represent the ML-KEM algorithm's
      |  security strength.
