--- abstract

Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) is a
quantum-resistant key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM). This document
specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 encoding format for ML-KEM in
public key certificates. The encoding for public and private keys are
also provided.

\[EDNOTE:
This document is not expected to be finalized before the NIST PQC
Project has standardized PQ algorithms. This specification will use
object identifiers for the new algorithms that are assigned by NIST,
and will use placeholders until these are released.]

# Introduction

<aside markdown="block">
  WARNING: This I-D includes examples. These examples were generated
  prior to NIST finalizing [DRAFTFIPS203].
</aside>

Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), previously
known as known as Kyber, is a quantum-resistant key-encapsulation
mechanism (KEM) standardized by the US NIST PQC Project {{NIST-PQC}}
in {{DRAFTFIPS203}}. This document specifies the use of ML-KEM in Public
Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates {{!RFC5280}} at three
security levels: ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024, using object
identifiers assigned by NIST.

This specification includes conventions for the subjectPublicKeyInfo
field within Internet X.509 certificates {{RFC5280}}, like {{?RFC3279}}
did for classic cryptography and {{?RFC5480}} did for elliptic curve
cryptography. The private key format is also specified.

## ASN.1 Module and ML-KEM Identifiers

An ASN.1 module {{X680}} is included for reference purposes. Note that
as per {{RFC5280}}, certificates use the Distinguished Encoding Rules;
see {{X690}}. Also note that NIST defined the object identifiers for
the ML-KEM algorithms in an ASN.1 module; see (TODO insert reference).

## Applicability Statement

ML-KEM certificates are used in protocols where the public key is used to
generate and encapsulate a shared secret used to derive a symmetric key used to
encrypt a payload; see {{?I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber}}. To be used in
TLS, ML-KEM certificates could only be used as end-entity identity
certificates and would require significant updates to the protocol; see
{{?I-D.celi-wiggers-tls-authkem}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}


# Identifiers

Certificates conforming to {{RFC5280}} can convey a public key for any
public key algorithm. The certificate indicates the algorithm through
an algorithm identifier. An algorithm identifier consists of an object
identifier and optional parameters.

The AlgorithmIdentifier type, which is included herein for convenience,
is defined as follows:

~~~
  AlgorithmIdentifier{ALGORITHM-TYPE, ALGORITHM-TYPE:AlgorithmSet} ::=
    SEQUENCE {
      algorithm   ALGORITHM-TYPE.&id({AlgorithmSet}),
      parameters  ALGORITHM-TYPE.
                    &Params({AlgorithmSet}{@algorithm}) OPTIONAL
    }
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: The above syntax is from {{!RFC5912}} and is compatible with the
  2021 ASN.1 syntax {{X680}}. See {{RFC5280}} for the 1988 ASN.1 syntax.
</aside>

The fields in AlgorithmIdentifier have the following meanings:

* algorithm identifies the cryptographic algorithm with an object
  identifier.

* parameters, which are optional, are the associated parameters for
  the algorithm identifier in the algorithm field.

The AlgorithmIdentifier for a ML-KEM public key MUST use one of the
id-alg-ml-kem-* object identifiers listed below, based on the security
level. The parameters field of the AlgorithmIdentifier for the ML-KEM
public key MUST be absent.

When any of the ML-KEM AlgorithmIdentifier appears in the
SubjectPublicKeyInfo field of an X.509 certificate, the key usage
certificate extension MUST only contain keyEncipherment
{{Section 4.2.1.3 of RFC5280}}.

    country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
    nistAlgorithm(4) }
  kems OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { nistAlgorithms 4 }

  id-alg-ml-kem-512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 1 }

  id-alg-ml-kem-768 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 2 }

  id-alg-ml-kem-1024 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 3 }

  NOTE: As noted in Section 3, the values for these object identifers
  will be assigned by NIST.  Once assigned, they will be added to a future
  revision of this document.

# Subject Public Key Fields

In the X.509 certificate, the subjectPublicKeyInfo field has the
SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, which has the following ASN.1 syntax:

~~~
  SubjectPublicKeyInfo {PUBLIC-KEY: IOSet} ::= SEQUENCE {
      algorithm        AlgorithmIdentifier {PUBLIC-KEY, {IOSet}},
      subjectPublicKey BIT STRING
  }
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: The above syntax is from {{RFC5912}} and is compatible with the
  2021 ASN.1 syntax {{X680}}. See {{RFC5280}} for the 1988 ASN.1 syntax.
</aside>

The fields in SubjectPublicKeyInfo have the following meaning:

* algorithm is the algorithm identifier and parameters for the
  public key (see above).

* subjectPublicKey contains the byte stream of the public key.  The
  algorithms defined in this document always encode the public key
  as TODO pick format e.g., exact multiple of 8 bits?.

The following is an example of a ML-KEM-512 public key encoded using the
textual encoding defined in {{?RFC7468}}:

  finalizing [DRAFTFIPS203].

# Private Key Format

"Asymmetric Key Packages" {{!RFC5958}} describes how to encode a private
key in a structure that both identifies what algorithm the private key
is for and allows for the public key and additional attributes about the
key to be included as well. For illustration, the ASN.1 structure
OneAsymmetricKey is replicated below. The algorithm-specific details of
how a private key is encoded are left for the document describing the
algorithm itself.

~~~
  OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
    version                  Version,
    privateKeyAlgorithm      SEQUENCE {
    algorithm                PUBLIC-KEY.&id({PublicKeySet}),
    parameters               PUBLIC-KEY.&Params({PublicKeySet}
                               {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})
                                  OPTIONAL}
    privateKey               OCTET STRING (CONTAINING
                               PUBLIC-KEY.&PrivateKey({PublicKeySet}
                                 {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})),
    attributes           [0] Attributes OPTIONAL,
    ...,
    [[2: publicKey       [1] BIT STRING (CONTAINING
                               PUBLIC-KEY.&Params({PublicKeySet}
                                 {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})
                                 OPTIONAL,
    ...
  }

  PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING

  PublicKey ::= BIT STRING
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: The above syntax is from {{RFC5958}} and is compatible with the
  2021 ASN.1 syntax {{X680}}.
</aside>

For the keys defined in this document, the private key is always an
opaque byte sequence. The ASN.1 type PqckemPrivateKey is defined in
this document to hold the byte sequence. Thus, when encoding a
OneAsymmetricKey object, the private key is wrapped in a
PqckemPrivateKey object and wrapped by the OCTET STRING of the
"privateKey" field.

~~~
  PqckemPrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING
~~~

The following is an example of a ML-KEM-512 private key encoded using the
textual encoding defined in {{RFC7468}}:

<aside markdown="block">
  WARNING: This example was generated prior to NIST
  finalizing [DRAFTFIPS203].
</aside>

~~~
  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
  TODO iser example private key
  -----END PRIVATE KEY-------
~~~

The following example, in addition to encoding the ML-KEM-512 private key,
has an attribute included as well as the public key. As with the
prior example, the textual encoding defined in {{RFC7468}} is used:

<aside markdown="block">
  WARNING: This example was generated prior to NIST
  finalizing [DRAFTFIPS203].
</aside>

~~~
  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
  TODO insert example private key with attribute
  -----END PRIVATE KEY-------
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: There exist some private key import functions that have not
  implemented the new ASN.1 structure OneAsymmetricKey that is defined in
  {{RFC5958}}. This means that they will not accept a private key
  structure that contains the public key field.  This means a balancing
  act needs to be done between being able to do a consistency check on the
  key pair and widest ability to import the key.

# Security Considerations

The Security Considerations section of {{RFC5280}} applies to this specification as well.

<aside markdown="block">
  To Do: Discuss side-channels for Kyber TBD1.
</aside>

# IANA Considerations

For the ASN.1 Module in {{asn1}}, IANA is requested to assign an
object identifier (OID) for the module identifier (TBD2) with a
Description of "id-mod-x509-ml-kem-2024".  The OID for the module
should be allocated in the "SMI Security for PKIX Module Identifier"
registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0).
