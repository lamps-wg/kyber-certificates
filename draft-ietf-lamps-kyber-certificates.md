The Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) is a
quantum-resistant key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM). This document
describes the conventions for using the ML-KEM in X.509 Public Key
Infrastructure. The conventions for the subject public keys and
private keys are also described.

# Introduction

The Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) standardized
in {{!FIPS203=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.203}} is a quantum-resistant key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM)
standardized by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
PQC Project {{NIST-PQC}}. Prior to standardization, the mechanism was known
as Kyber. ML-KEM and Kyber are not compatible. This document specifies the
use of ML-KEM in Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates {{!RFC5280}}
at three security levels: ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024, using object
identifiers assigned by NIST. The private key format is also specified.

## Applicability Statement

ML-KEM certificates are used in protocols where the public key is used to
generate and encapsulate a shared secret used to derive a symmetric key used to
encrypt a payload; see {{?I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kyber}}. To be used in
TLS, ML-KEM certificates could only be used as end-entity identity
certificates and would require significant updates to the protocol; see
{{?I-D.celi-wiggers-tls-authkem}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Algorithm Identifiers

The AlgorithmIdentifier type, which is included herein for convenience,
is defined as follows:

~~~
  AlgorithmIdentifier{ALGORITHM-TYPE, ALGORITHM-TYPE:AlgorithmSet} ::=
    SEQUENCE {
      algorithm   ALGORITHM-TYPE.&id({AlgorithmSet}),
      parameters  ALGORITHM-TYPE.
                    &Params({AlgorithmSet}{@algorithm}) OPTIONAL
    }
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: The above syntax is from {{!RFC5912}} and is compatible with the
  2021 ASN.1 syntax {{X680}}. See {{RFC5280}} for the 1988 ASN.1 syntax.
</aside>

The fields in AlgorithmIdentifier have the following meanings:

* algorithm identifies the cryptographic algorithm with an object
  identifier.

* parameters, which are optional, are the associated parameters for
  the algorithm identifier in the algorithm field.

The AlgorithmIdentifier for a ML-KEM public key MUST use one of the
id-alg-ml-kem object identifiers listed below, based on the security
level. The parameters field of the AlgorithmIdentifier for the ML-KEM
public key MUST be absent.

When any of the ML-KEM AlgorithmIdentifier appears in the
SubjectPublicKeyInfo field of an X.509 certificate, the key usage
certificate extension MUST only contain keyEncipherment
{{Section 4.2.1.3 of RFC5280}}.

~~~
  nistAlgorithms OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-ccitt(2)
    country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
    nistAlgorithm(4) }

  kems OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { nistAlgorithms 4 }

  id-alg-ml-kem-512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 1 }

  id-alg-ml-kem-768 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 2 }

  id-alg-ml-kem-1024 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 3 }

  pk-ml-kem-512 PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
    IDENTIFIER id-alg-ml-kem-512
    -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
    PARAMS ARE absent
    CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
    --- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
    }

  pk-ml-kem-768 PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
    IDENTIFIER id-alg-ml-kem-768
    -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
    PARAMS ARE absent
    CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
    --- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
    }

  pk-ml-kem-1024 PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
    IDENTIFIER id-alg-ml-kem-1024
    -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
    PARAMS ARE absent
    CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
    --- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
    }

    ML-KEM-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING

    ML-KEM-PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING
~~~

No additional encoding of the ML-KEM public key value is applied in
the SubjectPublicKeyInfo field of an X.509 certificate {{RFC5280}}.
However, whenever the ML-KEM public key value appears outside of a
certificate, it MAY be encoded as an OCTET STRING.

No additional encoding of the ML-KEM private key value is applied in
the PrivateKeyInfo field of an Asymmetric Key Package {{RFC5958}}.
However, whenever the ML-KEM private key value appears outside of a
Asymmetric Key Package, it MAY be encoded as an OCTET STRING.

# Subject Public Key Fields

In the X.509 certificate, the subjectPublicKeyInfo field has the
SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, which has the following ASN.1 syntax:

~~~
  SubjectPublicKeyInfo {PUBLIC-KEY: IOSet} ::= SEQUENCE {
      algorithm        AlgorithmIdentifier {PUBLIC-KEY, {IOSet}},
      subjectPublicKey BIT STRING
  }
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: The above syntax is from {{RFC5912}} and is compatible with the
  2021 ASN.1 syntax {{X680}}. See {{RFC5280}} for the 1988 ASN.1 syntax.
</aside>

The fields in SubjectPublicKeyInfo have the following meaning:

* algorithm is the algorithm identifier and parameters for the
  public key (see above).

* subjectPublicKey contains the byte stream of the public key.

{{example-public}} contains an example of an id-alg-ml-kem-768 public key
encoded using the textual encoding defined in {{?RFC7468}}.

# Private Key Format

An ML-KEM private key is encoded by storing its 64-octet seed in
the privateKey field as follows.

{{FIPS203}} specifies two formats for an ML-KEM private key: a 64-octet
seed and an (expanded) private key, which is referred to as the
decapsulation key. The expanded private key (and public key)
is computed from the seed using `ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal(d,z)` (algorithm 16)
using the first 32 octets as *d* and the remaining 32 octets as *z*.

"Asymmetric Key Packages" {{!RFC5958}} describes how to encode a private
key in a structure that both identifies what algorithm the private key
is for and allows for the public key and additional attributes about the
key to be included as well. For illustration, the ASN.1 structure
OneAsymmetricKey is replicated below. The algorithm-specific details of
how a private key is encoded are left for the document describing the
algorithm itself.

~~~
  OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
    version                  Version,
    privateKeyAlgorithm      SEQUENCE {
    algorithm                PUBLIC-KEY.&id({PublicKeySet}),
    parameters               PUBLIC-KEY.&Params({PublicKeySet}
                               {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})
                                  OPTIONAL}
    privateKey               OCTET STRING (CONTAINING
                               PUBLIC-KEY.&PrivateKey({PublicKeySet}
                                 {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})),
    attributes           [0] Attributes OPTIONAL,
    ...,
    [[2: publicKey       [1] BIT STRING (CONTAINING
                               PUBLIC-KEY.&Params({PublicKeySet}
                                 {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})
                                 OPTIONAL,
    ...
  }
~~~

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: The above syntax is from {{RFC5958}} and is compatible with the
  2021 ASN.1 syntax {{X680}}.
</aside>

When used in a OneAsymmetricKey type, the privateKey OCTET STRING contains
the raw octet string encoding of the 64-octet seed.

<aside markdown="block">
  NOTE: There exist some private key import functions that have not
  implemented the new ASN.1 structure OneAsymmetricKey that is defined in
  {{RFC5958}}. This means that they will not accept a private key
  structure that contains the public key field.  This means a balancing
  act needs to be done between being able to do a consistency check on the
  key pair and widest ability to import the key.
</aside>

{{example-private}} contains an example of an id-alg-ml-kem-768 private key
encoded using the textual encoding defined in {{?RFC7468}}.

# Security Considerations

The Security Considerations section of {{RFC5280}} applies to this
specification as well.

Protection of the private-key information, i.e., the seed, is vital to
public-key cryptography.  Disclosure of the private-key material to another
entity can lead to masquerades.

For ML-KEM specific security considerations refer to
{{?I-D.sfluhrer-cfrg-ml-kem-security-considerations}}.

The generation of private keys relies on random numbers. The use of
inadequate pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to generate these
values can result in little or no security.  An attacker may find it
much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced the keys,
searching the resulting small set of possibilities, rather than brute
force searching the whole key space.  The generation of quality
random numbers is difficult, and {{?RFC4086}} offers important guidance
in this area.

ML-KEM key generation as standardized in {{FIPS203}} has specific
requirements around randomness generation, described in section 3.3,
'Randomness generation'.

Key formats have implications on KEM binding properties, initially formalized
in {{CDM23}}. Per the analysis of the final {{FIPS203}} in {{KEMMY24}}, a
compliant instantiation of ML-KEM is LEAK-BIND-K-PK-secure and
LEAK-BIND-K-CT-secure when using the expanded key format, but not
MAL-BIND-K-PK-secure nor MAL-BIND-K-CT-secure. This means that the computed
shared secret binds to the encapsulation key used to compute it against a
malicious adversary that has access to leaked, honestly-generated key
material but is not capable of manufacturing maliciously generated
keypairs. This binding to the encapsulation key broadly protects against
re-encapsulation attacks but not completely.

Using the 64-byte seed format provides a step up in binding security by
mitigating an attack enabled by the hash of the public encapsulation key
stored in the expanded private decapsulation key format, providing
MAL-BIND-K-CT security and LEAK-BIND-K-PK security.

# IANA Considerations

For the ASN.1 Module in {{asn1}}, IANA is requested to assign an
object identifier (OID) for the module identifier (TBD2) with a
Description of "id-mod-x509-ml-kem-2024".  The OID for the module
should be allocated in the "SMI Security for PKIX Module Identifier"
registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0).
