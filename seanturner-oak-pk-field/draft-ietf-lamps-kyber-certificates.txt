1.  Introduction

   The Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM)
   standardized in [FIPS203] is a quantum-resistant key-encapsulation
   mechanism (KEM) standardized by the US National Institute of
   Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC Project [NIST-PQC].  Prior to
   standardization, the mechanism was known as Kyber.  ML-KEM and Kyber
   are not compatible.  This document specifies the use of ML-KEM in
   Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates [RFC5280] at
   three security levels: ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024, using
   object identifiers assigned by NIST.  The private key format is also
   specified.

1.1.  Applicability Statement

   ML-KEM certificates are used in protocols where the public key is
   used to generate and encapsulate a shared secret used to derive a
   symmetric key used to encrypt a payload; see
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kyber].  To be used in TLS, ML-KEM certificates
   could only be used as end-entity identity certificates and would
   require significant updates to the protocol; see
   [I-D.celi-wiggers-tls-authkem].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Algorithm Identifiers

   The AlgorithmIdentifier type, which is included herein for
   convenience, is defined as follows:

    AlgorithmIdentifier{ALGORITHM-TYPE, ALGORITHM-TYPE:AlgorithmSet} ::=
      SEQUENCE {
        algorithm   ALGORITHM-TYPE.&id({AlgorithmSet}),
        parameters  ALGORITHM-TYPE.
                      &Params({AlgorithmSet}{@algorithm}) OPTIONAL
      }

      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5912] and is compatible with
      |  the 2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].  See [RFC5280] for the 1988 ASN.1
      |  syntax.

   The fields in AlgorithmIdentifier have the following meanings:

   *  algorithm identifies the cryptographic algorithm with an object
      identifier.

   *  parameters, which are optional, are the associated parameters for
      the algorithm identifier in the algorithm field.

   The AlgorithmIdentifier for a ML-KEM public key MUST use one of the
   id-alg-ml-kem object identifiers listed below, based on the security
   level.  The parameters field of the AlgorithmIdentifier for the ML-
   KEM public key MUST be absent.

   When any of the ML-KEM AlgorithmIdentifier appears in the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo field of an X.509 certificate, the key usage
   certificate extension MUST only contain keyEncipherment
   Section 4.2.1.3 of [RFC5280].

     nistAlgorithms OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-ccitt(2)
       country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
       nistAlgorithm(4) }

     kems OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { nistAlgorithms 4 }

     id-alg-ml-kem-512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 1 }

     id-alg-ml-kem-768 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 2 }

     id-alg-ml-kem-1024 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { kems 3 }

     pk-ml-kem-512 PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
       IDENTIFIER id-alg-ml-kem-512
       -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       PARAMS ARE absent
       CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
       --- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       }

     pk-ml-kem-768 PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
       IDENTIFIER id-alg-ml-kem-768
       -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       PARAMS ARE absent
       CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
       --- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       }

     pk-ml-kem-1024 PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
       IDENTIFIER id-alg-ml-kem-1024
       -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       PARAMS ARE absent
       CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
       --- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
       }

       ML-KEM-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING

       ML-KEM-PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING

   No additional encoding of the ML-KEM public key value is applied in
   the SubjectPublicKeyInfo field of an X.509 certificate [RFC5280].
   However, whenever the ML-KEM public key value appears outside of a
   certificate, it MAY be encoded as an OCTET STRING.

   No additional encoding of the ML-KEM private key value is applied in
   the PrivateKeyInfo field of an Asymmetric Key Package [RFC5958].
   However, whenever the ML-KEM private key value appears outside of a
   Asymmetric Key Package, it MAY be encoded as an OCTET STRING.

4.  Subject Public Key Fields

   In the X.509 certificate, the subjectPublicKeyInfo field has the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, which has the following ASN.1 syntax:

     SubjectPublicKeyInfo {PUBLIC-KEY: IOSet} ::= SEQUENCE {
         algorithm        AlgorithmIdentifier {PUBLIC-KEY, {IOSet}},
         subjectPublicKey BIT STRING
     }

      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5912] and is compatible with
      |  the 2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].  See [RFC5280] for the 1988 ASN.1
      |  syntax.

   The fields in SubjectPublicKeyInfo have the following meaning:

   *  algorithm is the algorithm identifier and parameters for the
      public key (see above).

   *  subjectPublicKey contains the byte stream of the public key.

   Appendix B.2 contains an example of an id-alg-ml-kem-768 public key
   encoded using the textual encoding defined in [RFC7468].

5.  Private Key Format

   An ML-KEM private key is encoded by storing its 64-octet seed in the
   privateKey field as follows.

   [FIPS203] specifies two formats for an ML-KEM private key: a 64-octet
   seed and an (expanded) private key, which is referred to as the
   decapsulation key.  The expanded private key (and public key) is
   computed from the seed using ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal(d,z) (algorithm
   16) using the first 32 octets as _d_ and the remaining 32 octets as
   _z_.

   "Asymmetric Key Packages" [RFC5958] describes how to encode a private
   key in a structure that both identifies what algorithm the private
   key is for and allows for the public key and additional attributes
   about the key to be included as well.  For illustration, the ASN.1
   structure OneAsymmetricKey is replicated below.  The algorithm-
   specific details of how a private key is encoded are left for the
   document describing the algorithm itself.

     OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
       version                  Version,
       privateKeyAlgorithm      SEQUENCE {
       algorithm                PUBLIC-KEY.&id({PublicKeySet}),
       parameters               PUBLIC-KEY.&Params({PublicKeySet}
                                  {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})
                                     OPTIONAL}
       privateKey               OCTET STRING (CONTAINING
                                  PUBLIC-KEY.&PrivateKey({PublicKeySet}
                                    {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})),
       attributes           [0] Attributes OPTIONAL,
       ...,
       [[2: publicKey       [1] BIT STRING (CONTAINING
                                  PUBLIC-KEY.&Params({PublicKeySet}
                                    {@privateKeyAlgorithm.algorithm})
                                    OPTIONAL,
       ...
     }

      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5958] and is compatible with
      |  the 2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].

   When used in a OneAsymmetricKey type, the privateKey OCTET STRING
   contains the raw octet string encoding of the 64-octet seed.  The
   publicKey field SHOULD be omitted because the public key can be
   compute as noted earlier in this section.

      |  NOTE: There exist some private key import functions that have
      |  not implemented the new ASN.1 structure OneAsymmetricKey that
      |  is defined in [RFC5958].  This means that they will not accept
      |  a private key structure that contains the public key field.
      |  This means a balancing act needs to be done between being able
      |  to do a consistency check on the key pair and widest ability to
      |  import the key.

   Appendix B.1 contains an example of an id-alg-ml-kem-768 private key
   encoded using the textual encoding defined in [RFC7468].

6.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations section of [RFC5280] applies to this
   specification as well.

      |  To Do: Discuss side-channels for Kyber TBD1.

7.  IANA Considerations

   For the ASN.1 Module in Appendix A, IANA is requested to assign an
   object identifier (OID) for the module identifier (TBD2) with a
   Description of "id-mod-x509-ml-kem-2024".  The OID for the module
   should be allocated in the "SMI Security for PKIX Module Identifier"
   registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0).

Appendix A.  ASN.1 Module

   This appendix includes the ASN.1 module [X680] for the ML-KEM.  Note
   that as per [RFC5280], certificates use the Distinguished Encoding
   Rules; see [X690].  This module imports objects from [RFC5912] and
   [RFC9629].
